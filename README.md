# Dataset_analysing_PLP_wk7_Assignment
Loading and analyzing dataset using pandas library and creating simple plots and charts with the Matplotlib library for visualizing the data.# 🛒 Sales Data Analysis (Assignment)

## 📌 What this project is about
 I used **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** to analyze a real sales dataset.  
I loaded the data, cleaned it, did some analysis, and created charts to understand the sales better.  

---

## ⚙️ What I used
- Python 3  
- Pandas → to work with the dataset  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn → to make charts  
- Jupyter Notebook (inside VS Code)  

---

## 🪜 What I did
1. **Loaded the dataset** (`sales_data_sample.csv`) into Pandas  
2. **Checked the data** → rows, columns, missing values  
3. **Cleaned the data** → fixed dates and handled missing values  
4. **Basic analysis** → found averages, grouped by product line and country  
5. **Made 4 plots**:
   - Line chart → sales trend over time  
   - Bar chart → average sales per product line  
   - Histogram → distribution of sales amounts  
   - Scatter plot → relationship between quantity ordered and sales

## 📊 Observations
- Sales go up in some months (seasonal trend).  
- Classic Cars and trucks and buses had the highest sales.  
- Most transactions were under $5,000.  
- Bigger quantities usually mean more sales, but discounts made some exceptions.

## 🚀 How to run it
1. Put `sales_data_sample.csv` and `sales_analysis.ipynb` in the same folder.  
2. Open the notebook in VS Code with the Jupyter extension.  
3. Run each cell (Shift + Enter) to see the outputs and charts.

## ✅ Conclusion
I learned how to load a dataset, clean it, analyze it, and visualize it using Python.  
The analysis showed useful sales trends and helped me practice data analysis with real-world data.
